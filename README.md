Command-line Argument Parsing:

The parsing logic correctly handles --action and --id, though additional validation on argument format would improve reliability.
Action Handling:

The PerformAction method appropriately handles user actions like add, edit, delete, and show, with necessary checks for required studentId.
Consider simplifying action handling by centralizing common validation logic (e.g., studentId checks) to avoid repetition.
Interactive Menu:

The interactive menu offers a clean and user-friendly interface using Spectre.Console.
The menu options and user inputs are clearly defined, though modularizing the case handling further could reduce duplication.
Student Operations:

Methods like AddStudent, EditStudent, and DeleteStudent provide clear, input-based management for student data.
Validation for fields like ID and age is well handled; however, additional edge-case handling could be beneficial (e.g., handling invalid file paths or corrupt data on export/import).
Search Functionality:

The search functionality supports flexible querying based on various student attributes. Consider improving error handling for invalid query formats and offering user feedback for empty search results.
Export/Import:

The ExportData and ImportData methods are simple, but consider adding file existence checks before importing or exporting data.
Statistics:

The ViewStatistics method provides useful insights, like total student count and average age. It could be enhanced by adding additional statistics (e.g., highest age, student count by curriculum).
Overall Design:

The program is well-organized, leveraging Spectre.Console for a modern CLI interface. Improving error handling and extracting reusable validation logic would further enhance maintainability.
